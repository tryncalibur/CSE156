	- Uses Readline
	Known Issues: 
	   - Does not accept input greater than 1024 chars from stdin
	   - Does not clear Readline History

bin/myserver
	Usage: ./myserver <port>
	Executable file that will create a child process upon recieving a connection from a client and execute commands recieved and send the response back to server.
