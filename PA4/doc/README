Lab04: Web Proxy

Makefile: 
	Creates executable binary proxy in the bin directory

proxy.c
	Source file used to create proxy

proxy
	Usage: ./proxy <listen-port> <forbidden-sites-file>
	Executable binary used to listen to the given port and act as a proxy server. 

	Known Issues:
		- Does not work with HTTPS at all from what I have tested (mainly an issue with gethostbyname() returning NULL, same issue with getaddrinfo from what i've tested)
		- Connection is maintained after first call for 60 seconds, but is not tested.
		- Since recv return 0 on both server closing and reading 0 bytes, the connection request will check for reading size 0 for both server and client until 25 consecutive 0s have been read collectively from the two. Then the response will end.
		- The proxy server can only handle correctly formatted http request. A nonformatted request will cause unexpected errors and may close the thread it created without responding back to the client.
		- The proxy server will only log requests if the proxy server is capable of responding to the client.

		-- Overall
		- Works if requests are valid in terms of Host server being http and request format is correct
